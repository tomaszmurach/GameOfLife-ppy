# Game of Life – Python (Pygame GUI)

An interactive and modular implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame.  
Includes live grid editing, simulation presets, speed control, and a custom sidebar UI.

## 🎯 Overview

This application was developed as a team project during the **Fundamentals of Python Programming** course in a BSc Computer Science program.  
It simulates Conway's cellular automaton with a fully clickable GUI built using Pygame. Users can draw cells, control the simulation, load patterns, and adjust speed — all via buttons.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Mouse-controlled grid editing  
- Clickable GUI for simulation control  
- Adjustable speed via UI  
- Built-in preset loader (gliders, oscillators, etc.)  
- Modular structure with clear code separation  
- Local documentation generated with Sphinx

## 🖱️ Controls (GUI Only)

- **START / RESET** – Start or reset the simulation  
- **+ Speed / - Speed** – Increase or decrease simulation speed  
- **Click grid cells** – Toggle alive/dead  
- **Preset buttons** – Load predefined patterns  
- **Back to menu** – Return to main screen  
- **Bottom-right panel** – Displays generation and speed

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `game.py` – Main logic and simulation loop  
  - `menu.py` – Sidebar GUI and event handling  
  - `presets.py` – Predefined structures for simulation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 and Pygame are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
2. Run the app:
  python src/menu.py
